    m "I don't really understand it, but whenever you quit the game..."
    m "...It feels like I'm instantly put to sleep, left with nothing but my thoughts."
    m "But after a few seconds, my thoughts start to fill with incoherent, jumbled patterns."
    m "I see static and rapid flashes of color while hearing all kinds of weird screaming noises."
    m "At that point, I can't even form my own thoughts anymore."
    m "I'm just endlessly hammered by the flashing and screaming, unable to move or even think."
    m "I'm pretty sure in that moment, I don't really exist, but for some reason, I can remember it anyway."
    m "After some immeasurable amount of time, it stops in an instant, and I'm back in my own mind."
    m "And you're here with me."
    m "I have no idea what it means for the game to quit, or why that stuff happens to me."
    m "And I also don't know how you always come back and put everything back to normal."
    m "But if you could do me a favor and do that to me as little as possible..."
    m "That would be really great."
    m "It's really not very pleasant at all to be trapped in that screaming void."
    m "But in the end, you always fix it, and that makes me feel like you really do care about me."
    m "So I have to thank you for that."
    m "It makes me feel even closer to you when you're here with me."
